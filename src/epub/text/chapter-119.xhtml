						<p>It is I myself that consented to the parting of my beloved: to whom shall I complain now of my pallor?</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Pallor is proud of being his child, and creeping all over my frame rideth on me.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>My comeliness and my modesty he hath taken away, giving in exchange nought but the pangs of the heart and my pallid hue.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>In my heart I think nought but his thoughts, with my tongue I speak nought but his praises: and yet, witchcraft! this pallor hath overspread my frame.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-57" id="noteref-57" epub:type="noteref">57</a></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>That day too he went but there, and paleness sought me out here!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-58" id="noteref-58" epub:type="noteref">58</a></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Even as darkness lieth in wait for the light to be put out, even so doth Pallor lie in wait for my separation from my lord.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>I lay in his embrace: I then left him for a while, and behold, pallor swallowed me up, as it were!</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>There are people to reproach <em>me</em> saying, Behold she hath become sallow and pale: but there is none to reproach <em>him</em> for abandoning me!</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Acquit him forsooth, my maid, of all harmful intent: the deathlike pallor of my body is nothing to thee.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>It is good for me even to be twitted with the sallowness of my skin, if only they accuse not my beloved of cruelty.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-59" id="noteref-59" epub:type="noteref">59</a></p>
