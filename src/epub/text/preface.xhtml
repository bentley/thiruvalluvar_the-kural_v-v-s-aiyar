			<p>Very few in the world outside of the Tamil country have heard the name of the poet whose work is presented here in a new English garb. And yet he is one of those seers whose message is intended not merely for their own age or country but for all time and for all mankind. Born in the lowest of castes and bred up to the profession of weaving, which was his only means of livelihood till the day came for him to renounce all worldly ties, Tiruvalluvar has given to the world a work to which, in perfection of form, profundity of thought, nobleness of sentiment, and earnestness of moral purpose, very few books outside the grand scriptures of humanity can at all be compared. Indeed his work is eulogised by the Tamil people as the <i>Tamil Vêda, the universal Vêda, the later Vêda, the Divine book</i> etc., etc. It is a great pity that such a treasure should have been confined for so many ages only to one single people even in Hindusthan.</p>
			<p>The translation that I offer here is not the first translation of this <i>chef d'œuvre</i> in a European language. More than a century and a half ago the famous Jesuit missionary, Constantius Beschi, who lived in the Tamil country for 42 years, translated the first two parts of the book into Latin. This translation was available only in manuscript until the Rev. G. U. Pope printed it in the notes to his edition. It is this manuscript that Dr Graul is said to have used for his translations of the Kural into German as well as Latin. F. W. Ellis, W. H. Drew, E. J. Robinson, J. Lazarus and the late Rev. G. U. Pope have made translations into English of the whole or portions of the book at various dates between 1820 and 1886. M. Ariel and M. de Dumast have translated some stray portions into French. M. Ariel refers to a translation of the book into French by some author about 1767 which is to be found in the <i>Bibliothèque Nationale</i> of Paris, while he himself has published a French translation of Part III. M. Lamairesse has more recently published a complete translation in the same language, which, however, is little better than a bad paraphrase.</p>
			<p>As to the English translations with which we are more nearly concerned here, the edition jointly brought out by Drew and the great Râmânuja Kavirâyar is an excellent one, but it goes only up to 63 chapters out of a total of 133 and is now out of print. The only complete English edition that is possibly available now is Dr Pope's and it is 30 years old. He has given the Tamil text with his English translation of each verse under the text, has added a large number of valuable notes, and has prepared a combined lexicon and concordance which is very useful to the Tamil student. And what is more, he has printed in his notes the translations so far as they were available of Beschi and Ellis, and earned the thanks of all lovers of Tiruvalluvar.</p>
			<p>After seeing the English, French, and Latin translations above mentioned except those of Robinson and Lazarus and Graul and that of the <i>Bibliothèque Nationale</i>, my long cherished desire to make an independent translation of the great master into English only grew the stronger, and the result is the book which I am able to place before the public to-day.</p>
			<p>After a great deal of thought on the subject I have come to the conclusion that the Authorised English version of the Bible is the proper model to be followed by the translator of the Kural. The resemblance of the thought and diction of Tiruvalluvar to the great masterpieces of the Bible, and especially to the Ecclesiasticus, the Proverbs and Wisdom of Solomon, and the Sermons of Jesus, struck me forcibly, and I thought that if any portion of the vigour of the Kural could be preserved in English, it could only be by adopting the phraseology and the turns of expression of the English version of the Hebrew and Greek Vêda. The style of the English Bible lends itself, as everybody has felt, to the expression of every variety of thought, from the plain and the naive to the most sublime and dignified that the human mind can conceive. It would have been easy for Drew as well as Pope, who were members of the Christian Church, to have adopted such a style for the translation of Tiruvalluvar. But, as it is, Drew has given but a feeble translation, while Dr Pope's verses do not at all do justice to the merits of the original but on the contrary deform its grand thoughts by giving them a stilted and unnatural expression. The following examples will enable the reader to judge for himself:—</p>

				<p>In the translation of the titles of chapters also Pope has been singularly unhappy in many instances. Thus the headings, <i>The knowledge of power</i> (48),<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a> <i>Knowing the place</i> (50), <i>The right sceptre</i> (55), <i>Power in speech</i> (65), <i>Power in action</i> (67), <i>The knowledge of indications</i> (71), <i>The might of hatred</i> (87), <i>Knowing the quality of hate</i> (88), among others, are very unfortunate renderings of the original and do not give the reader any idea of what is contained in the respective chapters. A comparison of the translations of the verses and chapter headings of Drew and Pope given above, with those given in this book will show how much the former are lacking in force; and yet the latter do not render all the vigour and force of the original.</p>

					<p>Tiruvalluvar</p>
				</header>
				<p>We know very little about the life of our poet. As in the case of so many of the world's greatest men of the past, we have only to make our own conjectures even as to the time at which he flourished. Tradition says that he lived at Mylapore, Madras, where he had a friend in a rich merchant captain of the name of Elêla Shingan. This Shingan is described as the sixth descendant of a Chôla prince who, according to the Mahavamsho of Ceylon, carried on a successful war against that island about 10 BC. This would give the 1st century A. D. as the probable date at which Tiruvalluvar flourished. Again, tradition declares that the Kural was published at the Madura College of poets in the reign of the Pândian Ugrapperuvajudi. Shrîmân M. Srinivasa Aiyangår in his scholarly book of Tamil Studies gives the date of accession of this king tentatively as 125 A. D. Again, verse 55 of the Kural is quoted in Shilappadhikâram and Manimêkhalai, two great poems in the Tamil language, which have been determined on other evidence to have been written about the first or second century A. D. We can therefore take it that our poet flourished between the 1st and 3rd centuries of the Christian era. Shrîmân M. Râghava Aiyangâr, writing in his able work on Cheran Chen-Kuttuvan, has recently suggested the 5th century A. D. as the probable date of the two works above mentioned. But as it is admitted that the Kural is earlier in date than those two poems, this theory does not affect the limits above fixed for our Poet.</p>
				<p>The very name of the poet is unknown to history, for the word Tiruvalluvar only means "the devotee of the <i>valluva</i> caste," The <i>valluvas</i> are pariahs who proclaim the orders and commands promulgated by the king, by beat of drum from the back of elephants. From an encomiastic stanza on the author which tradition has preserved, it appears that he was born at Madura, the capital of the Pândias. Tradition declares that he was the child of a Brahman father named Bhagavan and a pariah mother Adi who had been brought up by another Brâhman and given in marriage to Bhagavan. Six other children are named as the issue of this union, all of whom have dabbled in poetry.</p>
				<p>Not much else is known about Tiruvalluvar besides the following bare facts. He was a weaver in Mylapore, having chosen weaving as the most innocent of all professions. He lived a happy family life until the death of his wife Vâsuki who was a model of every wifely virtue. Then he is said to have renounced the world and become an ascetic. A small book on the mysteries of wisdom, called Jnânavetti, is also attributed to him but the evidence of style seems to be against his authorship of it.</p>
				<p>The Tamil people love to tell stories about his married life, which may be true or may be false, but which certainly serve to show not only what was their conception of the ideal home but also that Tiruvalluvar's married life was in perfect agreement with the ideal as understood by them. Artless simplicity and unquestioning obedience to the husband are the first qualities that the East requires in the wife. Tiruvalluvar is said to have tested the faith of his prospective wife in him by asking her to boil and cook for him a handful of nailheads and other iron pieces. She took them in perfect faith and did as she was bid. The poet felt that she was the proper helpmate for him and married her. The fame of the happiness of their married life spread far and wide, A sage once visited him in order to ascertain for himself the truth of the report and to ask him whether he would recommend him to get married. Instead of answering the question directly, Tiruvalluvar wanted that the sage should draw his own conclusion after staying with him for some time. So he invited him to be his guest for a few days. One day as he and the guest were seated at their morning meal of cold rice and his wife was drawing water at the well in the yard, he called out to her saying that the rice was too hot for him to eat. Without questioning anything she left the water-pot even as she was drawing it up, and, hurrying to her husband's side, fanned the rice that was served on the leaf. Wonder of wonders, steam rose from the cold rice as she fanned it and, what was still more miraculous, the pot that she bad left to itself in order to obey her husband's call remained hanging in mid air in the same position in which she had left it! Another day, in broad daylight, as he was working at his loom, Tiruvalluvar dropped the shuttle on the floor and called for a light to look for it. Vâsuki lit a light and brought it to him without even the slightest consciousness of the unreasonableness of the request. The sage had received the Poet's answer : married life is the best even for scholars and searchers after truth if they can find a wife like Vasuki; otherwise they had better continue single all their life.</p>
				<p>The verse that is said to have escaped the lips of our Poet on the death of her who was the helpmate of his peaceful domestic life, is of a pathetic interest:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>O loving one! O thou who usedst to cook delicious dishes for me and who hast never disobeyed me! who wouldst chafe my feet at night and sleep after I had slept and wake before I had waked! Art thou going away from me now, O artless one? When shall these eyes know sleep again?</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>These are about all the things that have come down to us regarding the life of one of the greatest geniuses of the world.</p>
