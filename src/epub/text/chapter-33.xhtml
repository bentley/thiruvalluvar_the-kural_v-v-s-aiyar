				<li>
					<p>The greatest of virtues is non-killing: killing bringeth in its train every other sin.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>To divide oneâ€™s bread with the needy and to abstain from killing: this is the greatest of all the commandments of all the prophets.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The greatest virtue of all is non-killing: truthfulness cometh only next.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>What is the good way? It is the path that taketh thought how it may save even the smallest of creatures from being killed.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Among all that have renounced this life with its fears of ill, the chiefest is be that reverenceth all life for fear of killing any.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the man who hath taken the vow of non-killing: Death that eateth away all life maketh no inroads into his days.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Take not away from any living thing the life that is sweet unto all, even if it be to save thine own.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>They may say, Sacrifices gain for a man many blessings: but to the pure in heart the blessings that are earned by killing are an abomination.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Those who live by slaying are likened by the discriminating to eaters of carrion.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the man whose putrid body is festering with ulcerous sores: he must have been a shedder of blood in the past, say the wise.</p>
