				<li>
					<p>Men of worth fear vulgar company: but little-minded men mix with it as if they made one family with it.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Water altereth and taketh the character of the soil through which it floweth: even so the mind taketh the colour of the company with which it consorteth.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The understanding of a man belongeth unto his mind: but his reputation dependeth on the company he keepeth.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The disposition of a man seemeth to reside in his mind: but its veritable abode is the company in which he moveth.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Purity of heart and purity of action depend upon the purity of a manâ€™s company.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The pure of heart shall have a righteous progeny: and everything prospereth unto those that consort with good company.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Purity of heart is a treasure unto a man: and virtuous company bringeth him every glory.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Though themselves are endowed with every virtue, the wise looks upon the company of the pure as a tower of strength.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Virtue leadeth unto heaven: and the company of the good steadieth a man in the practice thereof.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>There is no greater ally to a man than good company: and nothing injureth so much as evil company.</p>
