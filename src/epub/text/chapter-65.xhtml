				<li>
					<p>The blessing of the tongue is a blessing indeed: for it is a blessing apart and formeth not part of other blessings.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Death and life are in the power of the tongue: guard thou therefore against imprudence of speech.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the speech that bindeth friends more closely and fascinateth even enemies: that alone is worthy of its name.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Weigh each circumstance aright and then speak the speech that is fit: for the increase of righteousness and profit there is no other thing of more worth to thee than it.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Speak thou the speech that cannot be silenced by any other speech.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>To speak so as to captivate oneâ€™s own hearers and to seize the sense in the words of others, that is the part of the consummate statesman.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the man who is eloquent of speech and knoweth neither confusion nor fear: it is impossible for anyone to beat him in debate.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the men whose speech is well ordered and couched in persuasive language: the world will be at their beck and call.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Verily they have a passion for much speaking who know not to say their mind in few and well chosen words.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the men who cannot expound unto others the knowledge that they have acquired: they are like unto the flower that blossometh but giveth forth no fragrance.</p>
