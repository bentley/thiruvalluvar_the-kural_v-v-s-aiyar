						<p>Why do my Eyes complain to me today? This inconsolable grief hath come even upon me only through <em>their</em> showing to me my beloved.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>How is it that the Eyes that looked rashly on the beloved that day grieve today, instead of bearing patiently the consequences of their own folly?</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>They looked on him straightway of their own free will that day, and today they weep of themselves: how they make themselves ridiculous!</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>After bequeathing to me the incurable grief that consumeth me, my Eyes have now dried up, having exhausted their store of tears.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>My Eyes which have brought on me this anguish vaster than the ocean, now pine away with grief and cannot even lay themselves to sleep.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Oh, it is a sweet revenge to me that the Eyes that caused me this sorrow are victims themselves to the selfsame anguish!</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Beshrew the eyes that hung upon his form on that day with a passionate, greedy, all-absorbing love! May they dry up to their very roots with pining and repining!</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Verily there be those who love without being loved! For here are my eyes which know no repose for not seeing him.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>My Eyes sleep not when he is away, neither sleep they when he is returned: either way it is their lot to suffer unceasing pain.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>When peopleâ€™s eyes themselves are telltale drums, even as my own, it is not hard for strangers to read the secret they seek to conceal.</p>
