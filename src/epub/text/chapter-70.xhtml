				<li>
					<p>Whoever desireth to move with princes, let him be like unto the men that warn then selves at a fire: let him not approach too near nor stand too far away.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Not to itch for those things that the prince desireth: that is the secret of acquiring his lasting favour and thereby growing in affluence.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>If thou desire not to fall into disgrace steer clear of all graver failings: for once suspicion is roused, it is impossible for anyone to remove it.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Speak not in whispers in the presence of the great ones: nor smile to anotherâ€™s face when they are near.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Do not try to overhear any conversation nor to fish out that which is withheld from thee: and then only receive the secret when it is imparted to thee.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Take into thy consideration the humour of the prince and the season that is, and then speak the words that will please him.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Speak those things before the prince that are pleasant to him; but things that are unprofitable, speak not ever even if he demandeth.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Trifle not with the prince because he is young or because he is thy kinsman or connection: but walk with awe before the light that is within him.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the men whose vision is unconfused and clear: they never do things that displease the prince, saying, we are favoured of him.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The men that rely on their intimacy with the prince and do unworthy deeds will perish.</p>
				</li>
