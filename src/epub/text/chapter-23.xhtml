					<p>Giving to the poor is alone charity: all other giving is of the nature of loan.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Though it lead unto heaven, receiving is bad: and though heaven should be denied to the giver, giving alms is a virtue.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>It is only the highborn man that giveth without ever meanly saying, I have not.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The heart of the giver is not glad until he seeth the smile of content on the face of the suppliant.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The conquest of conquests to the conqueror over self is the conquest over hunger: but his conquest cometh only after the conquest of him who appeaseth that hunger.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-15" id="noteref-15" epub:type="noteref">15</a></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>To fill the gnawing hunger of the poor: that is the way that the wealthy man should lay up riches for himself.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The evil disease called hunger toucheth not the man that divideth his bread with others.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The hard of heart who perish their wealth by hoarding it, have not they ever tasted the delight of giving unto others?</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Bitterer verily than the beggarâ€™s bread is the hoarded meal of the miser eating alone.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Nothing is bitterer than death: but even death is sweet when one hath not the power to do charity.</p>
