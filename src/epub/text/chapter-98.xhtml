				<li>
					<p>An aspiration for noble achievement, that is what is called greatness: and littleness is the thought that sayeth, I shall live without it.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The manner of birth is the same for all men: but their reputations vary because they differ in the lives that they lead.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Even if they are noble, those that are not noble are not noble; and even if they are lowborn, those that are not low are not low.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Even as chastity in a woman, greatness can be maintained only by being true to oneâ€™s own self.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Those that are great have the puissance to employ adequate means and achieve things that are impossible for others.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>It is not in the grain of small men to revere the great and earn their good will and favour.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>If fortune falleth to the lot of the little-minded their insolence will know no bounds.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Greatness is ever unpretending and modest; but littleness vaunteth its merits before all the world.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Greatness showeth condescension unto all: but littleness is the very acme of insolence.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Greatness is always for screening the infirmities of others: but littleness will talk nothing but scandal.</p>
