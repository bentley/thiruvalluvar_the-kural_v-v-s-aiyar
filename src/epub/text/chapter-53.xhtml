				<li>
					<p>Constancy of attachment even in adversity belongeth only unto kindred.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>If a man is blessed with kindred whose love for him bateth not, his fortunes will never cease to grow.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The man who rejoiceth not in the intimacy of his kindred is like a tank without bunds: the waters of prosperity will flow away from him.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>To gather and attach oneâ€™s kindred to oneself: that is the use and purpose of prosperity.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>If a man have a sweet tongue and a liberal hand his kinsmen will gather round him in serried ranks.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the man that giveth freely and entertaineth not anger: the world hath none who hath a more attached kindred than he.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The crow concealeth not its food selfishly from its fellows but shareth it lovingly with them: prosperity will abide only with men of a like nature.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>It is good if the prince treateth not all his kinsmen alike but hath a graduated scale for each: for there are many that have an eye to privilege.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The estrangement of a kinsman is easily remedied: remove the cause of the coolness and he will come back to thee.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>When a kinsman that hath broken with thee cometh back to thee for a reason, accept thou him, but with caution.</p>
