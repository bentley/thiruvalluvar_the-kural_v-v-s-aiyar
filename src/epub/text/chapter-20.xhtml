				<li>
					<p>Behold the man that angereth the public by the speaking of vain words: he will be despised of all men.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Worse even than injuring one's friends is the speaking of vain words before many.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>He that multiplieth empty words declareth loud his want of worth.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the man that speaketh vain words in an assembly: no profit will come unto him and all that is good will flee from his side.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Even the worthy will lose honour and respect if they indulge in vain speaking.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Call not bit man who loveth idle words: call him rather a chaff among men.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Let the wise, if they deem it meet, speak even hard words: but it is good for them to desist from profitless speech.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The wise whose thoughts are set on great questions utter not words that are profitless and vain.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>They whose eyes are whole say not vain words even by oversight.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Speak thou the speech that bringeth forth profit: but speak not ever words that are profitless and vain.</p>
				</li>
