				<li>
					<p>Behold that ravishing Beauty called Considerateness: the world cannot go on smoothly without her.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>In considerateness have the amenities of life their existence: those who possess it not are a burden unto the earth.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>To what end is the song that cannot be sung? and what is the worth of the eye that showeth not indulgence?</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>What is the use of eyes that merely show in the face, if they show not consideration for others according to their measure?</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Indulgence is the ornament of the eye: the eye that hath it not will be looked upon as a mere sore.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the men whose eyes show not consideration towards others: verily they are no better than the trees of the earth.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Verily they are blind, those who are not considerate towards others: and there are none that truly see but are indulgent to othersâ€™ faults.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the man who can be considerate towards others without derogating from any of his duties: he will inherit the earth.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>It is nobility to forbear and show indulgence even unto those that have offended thee.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Those who desire to be styled the very pink of courtesy will drink off even the poison that hath been mixed for them before their very eyes.</p>
