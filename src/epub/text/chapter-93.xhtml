					<p>Behold the men who are addicted to drink: they will never be feared by their enemies, and even the glory they have acquired they will lose.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Let none drink: but if they desire, let those men drink who care not for the esteem of worthy men.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The sight of the man who is intoxicated is an abomination even unto his own mother: what must it be then to the worthy?</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the man who is addicted to the low vice of drunkenness: the fair one called Shame turneth her back upon him.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>It is the veriest idiocy to spend oneâ€™s substance and obtain in return only insensibility.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the men who drink the poison called toddy day after day: they are as men that are asleep, neither do they differ from dead men.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the men who drink in secret and pass their days in torpid insensibility: their neighbours will soon find them out, and hold them in utter contempt.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Let not the drunkard pretend, saying, I know not even what it is to be drunk: for thereby he would merely add false. hood to his other vice.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the man who reproveth one who is intoxicated: he is like a man who searcheth torch in hand one who is immersed under water.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The man who seeth while he is sober the drunken state of another man, cannot he picture to himself his own state when he is drunk?</p>
