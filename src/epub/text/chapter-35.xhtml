				<p>341. Whatsoever thing a man hath renounced, from the grief arising from that thing hath he liberated himself.</p>
				<p>342. If thou want joy, renounce early: for many are the delights that thou shalt enjoy after renouncing,</p>
				<p>343. Crush thou the five senses: and everything in which thou takest delight, give up utterly.</p>
				<p>344. To possess nothing, that is the law of the man of vows: the possession of even one thing is a coming back to the snares that he hath left.</p>
				<p>345. To those that desire to put an end to their reincarnations, even the body is a superfluity: how much more then are other bonds?</p>
				<div class="__nop wst-nop"/>
				<p>346. The feelings of <i>I</i> and <i>Mine</i> are nought but vanity and pride: be who crusheth them entereth a higher world than the world of the Gods.</p>
				<p>347. Behold the man who holdeth on to attachments and giveth not them up: Grief shall take hold of him and shall not give him up.</p>
				<p>348. They that have renounced utterly are on the path to salvation: but the others are caught in a spare.</p>
				<p>349. The moment that attachments are broken, that very moment reincarnations cease: the man who breaketh them not continueth in vanity.</p>
				<p>350. Take thou refuge in Him who hath conquered all attachments: and hold fast to that ark in order that all thy bonds may be broken.</p>
