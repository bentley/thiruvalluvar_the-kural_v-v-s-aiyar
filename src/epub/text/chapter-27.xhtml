					<p>Patient endurance of suffering and non-injuring of life, in these is contained the whole of <i xml:lang="sa-Latn">tapas</i>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Austerities are for the austere of heart: it is profitless for others to take them up.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Is it because there should be some people to tend and feed ascetics that all the rest have forgotten <i xml:lang="sa-Latn">tapas</i>?</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>It thou wouldst destroy thy foes and exalt those that love thee, know that such a power belongeth unto <i xml:lang="sa-Latn">tapas</i>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><i xml:lang="sa-Latn">Tapas</i> fulfilleth all desires even in the very manner that is desired: therefore is it that men endeavour after <i xml:lang="sa-Latn">tapas</i> in this world.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>It is the men that do <i xml:lang="sa-Latn">tapas</i> that look after their own interests: the rest are caught in the snares of desire and only do themselves harm.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The fiercer the fire in which it is melted the more brilliant becometh the lustre of the gold: even so the severer the sufferings endured by the austere, the purer their nature shineth.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the man who hath attained mastery over himself: all other men worship him.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the men that have acquired power by austerities: they can succeed even in conquering death.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>If the needy are the many in the world, it is because those that do <i xml:lang="sa-Latn">tapas</i> are few, and those that do not, the larger number.</p>
