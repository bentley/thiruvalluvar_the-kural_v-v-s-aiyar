				<li>
					<p>The perennial light called Family will be extinguished if it is invaded by the foul vapour of sloth.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Let them call sloth by its real name and avoid it, those who desire to establish their family on a solid foundation.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the fool who huggeth assassin sloth unto his heart: his family will fall even before his day is ended.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the men who are sunk in sloth and who turn not their hand to any noble undertakings: their family will go to ruin and their vices will grow a pace.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Procrastination, forgetfulness, sloth, and sleep, these four are the cosy pleasure boats of those that are fated to perish.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The slothful can never thrive in the world even though they have the favour of princes.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the men who are slothful and who turn not their hand to any noble undertakings: they will listen to much reproof and contumely.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>If sloth find a home in a family, the family will soon be in bondage to its foes.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The afflictions that may have be fallen a manâ€™s family will cease to exist the moment he giveth up sloth.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the prince that knoweth not sloth: he will bring within his sway all that hath been measured by the steps of Trivikrama.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-28" id="noteref-28" epub:type="noteref">28</a></p>
