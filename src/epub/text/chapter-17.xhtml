				<li>
					<p>Guard thyself from envious thoughts: for freedom from envy is a part of virtuous conduct.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>No blessing is so great as a nature that is free from all envy.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>It is he that careth not for virtue or for wealth that envieth his neighbour's prosperity.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The wise injure not others through envy: for they know the evils that result therefrom.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Envy itself is scourge enough for the envious man: for, even if his enemies spare him, his own envy will work his ruin.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the man that beareth not to see gifts made to another: his family will beg for very food and clothing and perish.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Lakshmi<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> cannot bear with the envious: she will abandon them to the care of her elder sister<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> and quit their side.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Caitiff Envy bringeth on indigence and leadeth up to the gates of hell.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The affluence of the envious and the misery of the generous-minded are alike matter for wonder.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Never hath envy led to prosperity: nor a liberal heart to a fall therefrom.</p>
