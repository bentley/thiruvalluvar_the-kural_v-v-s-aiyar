				<li>
					<p>Deliberate well and lean not to either side: be impartial and consult with the men of law: that is the way to administer justice,</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The world looketh up to the rain-cloud for life: even so do men look up to the sceptre of the prince for protection.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The sceptre of the prince is the mainstay of the science of the Br√¢hmans and of righteousness also.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the noble prince who ruleth the people of his dominions with loving care: sovereignty will never depart from him.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the prince who wieldeth the sceptre in accordance with the law: seasonal rains and rich harvests have their home in his land.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>It is not the lance that bringeth victory unto the prince: it is rather his sceptre, and that provided it is straight and leaneth not to either side.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The prince is the protector of all his people: and him his sceptre shall guard, provided he alloweth it not ever to lean to either side.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the prince who is not easy of access and who judgeth not causes with care: he will fall iron his place and perish, even when lie hath no enemy.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Behold the prince that guardeth his subjects from enemies both within and without: if he punish them when they go wrong it is not a blemish: it is his duty</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Punishing the wicked with death is like the removing of weeds from the cornfield.</p>
